You are taking a trip in your favorite rocket ship flying through the sky, going bye bye. 

How To Play:

You are the ship on the left side of the screen and your goal is to survive as long as possible and destroy as many enemy ships as possible. Your ship has gravity and if you fall to the bottom of the screen, it's game over. You gain points gradually for surviving and gain additional points for destroying the various enemies. Some ships are worth more than others. Asteroids are indestructible and you must dodge them as they float past.
